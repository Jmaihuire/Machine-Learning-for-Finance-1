Write a jupyter notebook in which you

- load the "home_prices_train.csv" file into a dataframe
- linearly regress saleprice (column 'SalePrice') with integer and real variables in the training data. You can try univariant or multivariant with all possible variable combinations.
- use R^2 or mean-squared-error to evaluate the fit, and conclude by choosing the best variable(s), and reporting the corresponding R^2 or mean-squared-error
- parse the data if necessary; make plots if it helps; include comments to make code clear 
   (bonus points) engineer variables from original ones, try achieve better scores

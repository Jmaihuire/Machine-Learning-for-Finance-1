Apply SVM classification and regression to credit default data set and home price data set. Write a jupyter notebook in which you

- Search the best hyperparameters (gamma, C, epsilon,...) for SVM both in-sample and out-of-
  sample (divide the whole set into training and testing).
- Compare with logistic regression and linear regression, determine which one is better.
- Use "predict_proba" method in SVM classification to make probability prediction and compute  
  log loss, change feature combination to find the best log loss (smallest). Test whether predictions with higher probabilities have better performance. 

Couldn't do much because SVM is computationally very expensive to train and took very long to run.

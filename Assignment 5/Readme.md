1. Apply Random Forest classification and regression to credit default data set and home price data set. Use 10 fold cross-validation to tune the following hyper-parameters:

- n_estimators 
- max_features
- max_depth
- min_weight_fraction_leaf
2. Compare your cross-validation precision/recall/F1-score in the credit default data set 
   between

- Random Forest classification
- SVM
- Logistic regression

and mse in the home price data set between

- Random Forest regression
- SVR
- Linear regression
